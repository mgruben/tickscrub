tickscrub looks for a view file in the given directory, then drops a finalOutput file in that same directory.

To create the view file:
(1) Go to an event and "inspect element" within chromium on one of the listed ticket prices.
(2) Scroll up until you see an element called <tbody>, and right-click that to "Copy as HTML."
(3) Paste into a file named "view" in the directory of your choice.
(You'll probably have to do this for as many pages as there are listings until a better way can be found.)

----Directories should be named according to the convention event/dd-mm-yyyy_hhmm in 24-hour format----
